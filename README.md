# The 0/1 knapsack problem with dynamic programming with the top-down (recursive) algorithm: comparing execution speeds of programming languages

2023-09-19...: a work in progress (WIP)

First batch of programming languages:
* Python: albeit slow, if possible this is my reference for calculating a correct result for an unknown test case
* C++
* C#
* Rust

Important things first (with Python see below):
